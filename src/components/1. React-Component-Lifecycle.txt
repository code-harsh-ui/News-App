React Component Lifecycle -

These are the series of events that happen from the mounting of a React component to its unmounting.
1. Mounting - Birth of your component
2. Update - Growth of your component
3. Unmount - Death of your component

These are the methods in React Component Lifecycle
1. render() method - method is used to render HTML of the component in react. This method is required for a class based component to render the DOM. It runs during the mounting and updating of your component. render() should be pure it means we can only use state value but cannot modify state inside it.

2. componentDidMount() method - method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. In this method we can set states, use async await and fetch api

3. componentDidUpdate() method is invoked as soon as the updating happens. The most common use case for the componentDidUpdate() method is updating the DOM in response to prop or state changes.

4. componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method is called just before the component in unmounted and destroyed. Usually used to perform cleanups.
